The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, in the event of the activation of IP anonymisation on this website, your IP address will be shortened beforehand by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there.

With the statistics obtained we can improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user.
